<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Congratulations, you've made it to the final stage of building your Tic-Tac-Toe game! Now, it's time to take things to the next level by creating a truly formidable AI opponent using advanced techniques and AI tools to boost your productivity.</p><p style="text-align: start;">In this stage, you'll implement a <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level, where the AI becomes an unbeatable opponent. Unlike the <code class="java">medium</code> level, where the AI only looks one move ahead, the hard AI will use the <strong>minimax algorithm</strong> to analyze the entire game tree. This means it can predict not just the next move, but all possible future moves, ensuring it plays perfectly from start to finish. The AI will assume that its opponent plays optimally as well, making it a true challenge for even the best players.</p><p style="text-align: start;">But here's the twist: you'll now incorporate AI-powered coding tools to enhance your workflow. Whether it's using <strong>AI code assistants</strong> to help you write or debug the minimax algorithm or <strong>automated review tools</strong> to ensure your AI behaves as expected, these tools will streamline your development process and help you focus on the logic behind the minimax algorithm itself.</p><p style="text-align: start;">The minimax algorithm is a classic brute-force technique that maximizes the AI’s chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's. It's not just limited to Tic-Tac-Toe; this algorithm is used in a range of two-player games like chess, checkers, and more. By combining your own skills with AI-powered tools, you’ll be able to implement this complex algorithm more efficiently.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Implement the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level using the minimax algorithm.</p></li><li><p>Leverage AI tools to assist you in writing, debugging, testing, and documenting your code.</p></li><li><p>Add a parameter that allows users to select the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level when playing against the AI.</p></li></ul><p style="text-align: start;">By the end of this stage, you'll not only have a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable AI opponent, but you'll also have gained valuable experience using AI tools to enhance your coding productivity.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>The example below shows how your program should work.<br/>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.
